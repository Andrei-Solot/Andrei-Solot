AI & Data Engineer | Applied Machine Learning

I design and build end-to-end AI and data systems, taking projects from early research and prototyping through to production deployment. My work focuses on applied machine learning, data engineering, and automation, with an emphasis on reliability, scalability, and practical impact.

Most of my work is in private repositories and client systems, this profile is for testing and or passion projects and interests.
